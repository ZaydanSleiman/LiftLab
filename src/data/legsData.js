Release the weight and extend your legs fully, without locking your knees.
Lower the weight until your legs are at a 90° angle (but DO NOT allow your butt and lower back to rise off of the pad. This will put your lower back in a rounded position, which is very dangerous.)
Raise the weight back to starting position.
